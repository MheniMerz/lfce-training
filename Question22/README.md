# Question

One of the divisions within your organization needs to have their own `SMTP` relay server configured. To accomplish this you should:

Install, enable and configure `Postfix` to provide an `SMTP` service for `c.tux.rocks` . `Postfix` should relay only for this domain.

This division has advised that they have been receiving a significant amount of spam from a number of fake addresses on the domain `example.net` and would like the entire domain blacklisted.

A client of the division has advised that sometimes their mail is not received, and have requested explicit whitelisting the domain `example.com` .
