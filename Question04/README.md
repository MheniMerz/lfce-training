Working with volumes is an important engineering skill. Perform the following to demonstrate your skills:

Create a volume-group named `vg2` on disks `/dev/xvdt1`, `/dev/xvdt2`, `/dev/xvdt3` with physical extent size of `5MB`
Create a striped volume `stripedVol3` on `vg2` with size `30MB` with stripe-size `64K`
Create a mirrored volume `mirroredVol1` on `vg1` with size `32MB`
Extend the size of existing volume `linearVol2` by `12MB`
