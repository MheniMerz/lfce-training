# Question

In order to easily identify block devices in the system, you are have been tasked with adding symlinks under `/dev` for devices being utilized. To demonstrate your ability to do this, use `udev` to create a persistent symlink `/dev/prod_data` targeting the block device `/dev/xvdw1` . `/dev/xvdw1` contains an unmounted `ext4` filesystem, and is already present on the remote system `node-2` .

Return to the base node upon completion.
