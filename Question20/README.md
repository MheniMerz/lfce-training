System administrators and systems engineers are frequently tasked with manipulating text files, whether they contain configuration, data, or comprise script or programming source code. Complete the following tasks to demonstrate your ability to programatically manipulate file content:

Create the file `/opt/CECM00201/output/colon_delimited.txt` , containing the contents of column 1 from the colon-delimited file `/opt/CECM00201/input/colon_delimited.txt` . The output should be sorted in reverse order, and any duplicate rows should be removed.
Create the file `/opt/CECM00201/output/comma_delimited.txt` , containing the contents of the 2nd and 3rd columns from the comma-delimited file `/opt/CECM00201/input/comma_delimited.txt` . The output should remain comma-delimited and be sorted numerically by the value in the third column in the default ascending order.

Create the file `/opt/CECM00201/output/user_rows.txt` , containing any lines from `/opt/CECM00201/input/user_rows.txt` which contain both of the whole words root and user in any order. Do not sort this output or manipulate it any further.

Create the file `/opt/CECM00201/output/high_scores.txt` , containing any row from the colon-delimited file `/opt/CECM00201/input/high_scores.txt` , where the first column contains an integer value greater than `100` . Sort this output in default ascending order, based upon the contents of the third column.
