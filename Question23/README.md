The website that your organization owns has seen significant increases in traffic over the past two quarters. As part of service optimization, you have been tasked with installing the `Squid` proxy in order to reduce bandwidth and improve page load times for your growing website. To do this, please complete the following:

- Install the `squid` proxy server
- Configure `squid` as a basic reverse proxy, listening on `8164` for your website `localhost` and directed to the real webserver IP found by issuing the following command: `getent hosts app-0`
- Ensure the proxy server is configured to start automatically on boot
