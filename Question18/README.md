# Question

Fixing issues with the system's mandatory access control system are common when these frameworks are enforcing. The Maria DB server on this system is unable to start so please perform the following:

- Diagnose and fix the issue
- When you have fixed the problem, leave the Maria DB server running
- You should not change the Maria DB configuration, nor should you disable the system's mandatory access control system or place it in `permissive` / `complaining` mode, or `remove` / `disable` any specific policies.

*Note:* on Ubuntu systems, the Maria DB systemd service unit is called `mysql.service`
